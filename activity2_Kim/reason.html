    <h1 align="center">Why I would like to visit South Island:</h1>
    <p>
      To be completely honest, I did not have a specific place I would like to visit in mind for this assignment.
      Therefore, I google'd "top places to visit around the world". The location ranked
      first place was South Island, New Zealand, which I chose as the topic of this assignment. However, looking
      for images about South Island and researching the activities available to put in this assignment has most definitely
      encouraged me to visit one day! -  <em>Eunsu (David) Kim</em>
