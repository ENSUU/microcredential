          <b>Komodo National Park</b> is located between the islands of Sumbawa and Flores
          in the East Nusatenggara province. The Komodo National Park encompasses a total of 29 volcanic islands - which include the three major islands of <b>Rinca, Padar, and Komodo.</b>
          <br><br>
          Komodo National Park currently houses approximately 2,500 Komodo Dragons and is the only place in the world where you can find them!
          <br><br>
          <u><i>Please note, these animals are considered wild and free. Visitors are urged to keep their distance and exercise EXTREME caution. You must hire an experienced ranger to visit!</i></u>
          However, if you would prefer not to meet these creatures, that is ok!
          <br><br>
          The park's terrain is uniquely diverse, consisting of mountainous hillsides, tropical rainforests, a grassland-woodland savannah, and white sandy beaches that harbor rich marine biodiversity!
          Planning your future trip with the travel agency, <a target="_blank" class="goToKomodoPlug" href="https://www.gotokomodo.com/">Go To Komodo</a>, will allow you to experience the park to the fullest!

        <p>
          Located in the island of Bali, the Ubud Monkey Forest currently has almost 600 monkeys living in the area!
          <br><br>
          This is a 30 acre jungle area surrounding a 14th century Hindu temple, located in the heart of Ubud, a town in Bali.
          <br><br>
          Unlike the experience you would get at the zoo, interactions with the monkeys is more natural since they are free to roam around!
          <br><br>
          <i>- Note: The Bali Monkey Forest can get a bit wild.</i>
